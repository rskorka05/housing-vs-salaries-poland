Comparison of flat prices and earnings in Polish provinces (analysis in Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).

The project presents an analysis of the relationship between average gross earnings and flat prices in individual provinces in Poland.
The aim was to check in which regions flats are most and least affordable in relation to earnings.

Project structure:

* “analiza_mieszkania_vs_zarobki.ipynb” – Jupyter notebook with full analysis
* “ceny_mieszkan.csv” – data on flat prices (average price per m²)
* “zarobki.csv” – data on average gross earnings
* “README.md” – project description

Technologies:

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

Key findings: Most affordable flats: - Podkarpackie Province – ~1.07 salary/m² - Świętokrzyskie Province – ~1.09 salary/m² - Podlaskie Province – ~1.09 salary/m²

Least affordable flats: - Dolnośląskie - ~1.32 salary/m2 - Mazowieckie - ~1.41 salary/m2 - Pomorskie - ~1.52 salary/m2

The project shows that the availability of housing in Poland varies significantly between regions.
High earnings in large cities (e.g. Warsaw) do not always translate into better housing availability, as prices there are proportionally much higher.
